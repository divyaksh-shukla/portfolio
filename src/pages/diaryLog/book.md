I read some leisure books on statistics and data science. 

I have finished **"Art of Statistics" by David Speigelhalter** and **"Weapons of Math Destruction" by Cathy O'Niel**. Both are great leisure reads and give great insights on the progress, challenges and obscurities large amounts of data has brought upon us. 

These 2 books have given me some satisfaction and some food for thought.
