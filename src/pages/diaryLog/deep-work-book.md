I’m currently reading a book titled **Deep Work** by Cal Newport. In the book, Cal discusses his philosophy in producing work output and researching. The author is from a computer science background, which is clearly evident in his work.

Cal Newport starts out by giving examples of how people produce research output through “Deep Work”. He starts out by explaining a mansion created by Carl Jung to write scriptures and articles to tackle the philosophy of Sigmond Freud and his followers. Carl made a mansion away from the central city with a large room to concentrate on writing essays for journals and newspapers.

Cal then goes on the set the rules we all should follow to work in-depth. He lays forth 2 rules and many variations in applying those rules. The 2 rules go hand in hand, but only 1 of the variations of each rule can be chosen.

I think this is a great book to motivate me to work in-depth and produce research output. I remember that during my days in filing my patent, I used to work day and night on my laptop, making variations to the data transformations, data generation scripts, data features, and model parameters. This way, I implemented my mentor’s idea of having a Data Quality recommender that could be trained just like a machine learning model. Thereby reducing (or completely removing) the need for hand-made transformations and patterns.

I hope to find many such books during my endeavors in life and get an opportunity to meet the author of “Deep Work”, Cal Newport.
