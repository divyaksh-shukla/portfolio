I had ordered a book on *"Deep Reinforcement Learning Hands-on" by Maxim Lapan* last week. Its been a week since I have been reading this book and it sure has a good and relatable introduction to understand reinforcement learning. The book drew a clear line between supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning but also gave relevant points as to how reinforecement learning picks up from the limitations supervised and unsupervised learnings have when exposed to practical scenarios.

Reinforcement learning involves an `agent` and its `environment`. The agent performs some `action` on the `environment` and obtains some `result` and `observations`. This is exactly like how babies learn from their environment. In addition, babies also recieve instructions from their teachers/guardians/parents on how to act based on a given situation or `state`. In contrast to babies, an `agent` only comes to know which action is best based on the previous `result` of that action.

I have started to spend more time reading and writing now. So I hope I can finish this monster-of-a-book very soon.
