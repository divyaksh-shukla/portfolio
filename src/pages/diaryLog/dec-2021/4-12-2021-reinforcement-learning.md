Along with Deep Reinforcement Learning Hands-On I also started reading **Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction by Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto**. This book is widely accepted to be the bible in reinforcement learning space. It starts off with an introduction to the realm of reinforcement learning and how it can be applied in conjunction with supervised and unsupervised learning while being drastically different in its approach. 

The authors begin with a nice and easy example of tic-tac-toe, rather than the complicated game of chess or an abstract game to which we cannot relate to. With the example of tic-tac-toe introduced at the beginning, it becomes very easy to grasp the complex theory and motivation behind reinforcement learning.

The authors also side track the introductory chapter by diving deep into the history of reiforcement learning. Sutton and Barto wrote this book at a very relevant time as they had the fortune of not just reading through the history but also getting their writings revised by the same people who made the history. 

This book is now my collection of actively read books and I tend to cover around a chapter or 2 per-day, even though it is not in the syllabus of my current course at BITS-Pilani. 

Interestingly, I found many of the basic concepts of reinforcement learning also in natural language processing. This not only explains the combination of using reinforcement learning to make chatbots but also hints towards the concept of *"transfer learning"* in reinforcement learning.
